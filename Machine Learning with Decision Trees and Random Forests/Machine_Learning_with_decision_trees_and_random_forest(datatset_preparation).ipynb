        "*   **int.rate**: The interest rate of the loan, as a proportion (a rate of 11% would be stored as 0.11). Borrowers judged by LendingClub.com to be more risky are assigned higher interest rates.\n",

        "*   **inq.last.6mths**: The borrower's number of inquiries by creditors in the last 6 months.\n",
