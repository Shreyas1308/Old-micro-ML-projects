# Old-micro-ML-projects

I've found some old python notebooks that I had created when I was learning machine learning. Here are some of them listed:

1. `ML with Logistic Regression`: Using Logistic Regression to predict whether an internet user clicked an ad or not.

2. `ML with K Nearest Neighbours`: Using KNN to classify instances from a fake dataset into two target classes, while choosing the best value for K using the elbow method.

3. `ML with Decision Trees and Random Forests`: Using Decision Trees and Random Forests to predict whether a lender will pay their loan back. Uses publically available data from LendingClub.com

4. `Movie Recommendations using Recommender Systems`: A micro project to build a recommendation system that makes movie recommendations based on user review similarities.
