# Old-micro-ML-projects

I've found some old python notebooks that I had created when I was learning machine learning. Here are some of them listed:

1. `ML with Logistic Regression`: Using Logistic Regression to predict whether an internet user clicked an ad or not.

2. `ML with K Nearest Neighbours`: Using KNN to classify instances from a fake dataset into two target classes, while choosing the best value for K using the elbow method.
